Port 515 is used as an LPR/LPD port for most printers and older print servers. Port 631 is used for IPP for most modern printers and CUPS-based print servers. Port 9100 is used as a RAW port for most printers and is also known as the direct-IP port.

Metasploit can trigger buffer overflows in SCADA systems.

An MX record is used for outgoing (SMTP) and incoming (POP3/IMAP) traffic.

| **Kayıt Tipi** | **Anahtar Kelime / Kullanım** |

LDAP uses port 389 by default enrypted ones uses port 636. 3389 is RDP. SLP is port 427.

Former employee is Insider Threat.

Service and version identification are often performed by conducting a banner grab or by checking responses for services to known fingerprints for those services.

**To commit industrial espionage** is not a valid reason to conduct reverse engineering.

Vulnerability reports should include both the physical hosts and the virtual hosts on the target network. A common mistake of new cybersecurity analysts is to include physical hosts, thereby missing many network assets.

Hardening is usually the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability.

MAC flooding is a technique employed to compromise the security of switched network devices. The attack forcing legitimate MAC addresses out of the table of contents in the switch and forcing a unicast flooding behavior, potentially sending sensitive information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended to go. Essentially, since the switch table of contents is flooding with bad information, the switch could fail open and begin to act like a hub, broadcasting all the frames out of every port. This would allow the attacker to sniff all network packets since he is connected to one of those switch ports.

The only truly unbreakable encryption is one that uses a one-time use pad.

The Diffie-Hellman (DH) is used to exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel securely and was one of the first public-key protocols (Asymmetric).

Smart cards, PIV, and CAC devices are used as an identity and access management control. These devices contain a digital certificate embedded within the smart card (PIV/CAC) presented to the system when it is inserted into the smart card reader. 

Injecting parameters into a connection string using semicolons as a separator is type of technique for exploit chaining often implement.

Application-aware firewall would be the most effective technology to detect and block this type of traffic.

The PII of employees should not be given to a penetration tester as this could violate laws and regulations regarding maintaining employee data confidentiality and privacy. 

Penetration tester has exploited the FTP server from outside the LAN, they will need to set up a route statement in meterpreter.

WEP is the least secure Wireless Security Protocol.

Segmentation is the best method to reduce the risk to an embedded ICS system from a network-based compromise.

Passive reconnaissance combines publicly available data from various sources about an organization and does not use active scanning or data gathering methods.

WPS enabled wireless networks has a weaknes for brute force occurs within 11.000(or+) combinations.

The net user command allows system administrators to manage user accounts on Windows PCs.

Wireless access points can utilize MAC filtering to ensure only known network interface cards are allowed to connect to the network.

Blowfish is a legacy symmetric encryption algorithm that is not PKI X.509 compliant due to its 64-bit block size vulnerability, unlike the industry-standard AES.

Non-repudiation occurs when a sender cannot claim they didn’t send an email when they did.

Class B network is /16 because Subnet Mask is 255.255.0.0

A Jumpbox is a hardened intermediary server used to segment and control remote administrative access to internal network resources, acting as a single audit point.

ECC provides equivalent security to RSA with significantly smaller key sizes, making it the ideal asymmetric algorithm for resource-constrained devices like smartphones.

A karma attack is a variant of the evil twin attack. 

IoT devices focus convenience more than security.

A misconfigured DNS Zone Transfer allows an attacker to replicate the entire DNS database, revealing critical network topology and internal IP addresses.

Deauthentication attacks are used in the service of an evil twin, replay, cracking, denial of service, and other attacks.

RSA is asymmetric algorithm.

The net use command will list network shares that the workstation is using.

A PTR record acts as a pointer for Reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address back to a hostname, unlike an A record which maps a hostname to an IP.

ScoutSuite is an open-source multi-cloud security auditing tool that assesses the configuration posture of environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP via their APIs.

LM hashes are limited to 14 characters, convert all input to uppercase, and use the DES algorithm, making them highly vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

MAC Spoofing is the technique of changing a network interface's factory-assigned MAC address to bypass access control lists or conceal the attacker's identity.
